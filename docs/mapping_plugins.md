Eik provide a set of build tool plugins which cater for applying Import Maps ahead of time. 

The common functionallity of these plugins is that they will, if found, load the `eik.json` in a project and fetch the defined Import Maps and then apply these to the code the build tool is processing.

When using a build tool to apply an Import Map ahead of time, the build process should be run before a module is published to a Eik server.

## Available plugins

The following build tool plugins are available:

 - [Rollup](https://github.com/eik-lib/import-map-rollup-plugin)
 - [PostCSS](https://github.com/eik-lib/import-map-postcss-plugin)
